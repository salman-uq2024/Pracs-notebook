# COMP4702 2025 - Pracs Notebook

## Introduction

Welcome to the COMP4702 course! This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files that serve as a starter code for the prac sheet. To work with these notebooks, you have multiple options:

- **Jupyter Notebook** (local installation)
- **Google Colab** (cloud-based, no installation required)
- **Your favorite IDE** (e.g., VS Code with Jupyter extension, PyCharm, etc.)
- **And many more...**

If you are unsure about how to set up your environment, we recommend installing **Anaconda**, as it provides a simple and complete setup for working with Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Setting Up the Environment

The easiest way to set up your machine learning environment is by installing **Anaconda**, which includes Python, Jupyter Notebook, and essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. This eliminates the need to install them individually.

### Installing Anaconda

Follow these steps to install Anaconda:

1. **Download Anaconda** from the official website: [Anaconda Download](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)
2. Follow the installation instructions provided on the website based on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Once installed, you can launch Jupyter Notebook by opening the terminal (or Anaconda Prompt) and running:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

This will open Jupyter Notebook in your web browser, allowing you to run and modify the provided notebooks.
